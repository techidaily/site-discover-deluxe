First things first, Wave Browser is a Chromium-based platform available in two versions. One is developed by Eightpoint Technologies Ltd. SEZC, accessible at https://gowavebrowser.com or https://wavebrowser.co. The other, by iSign International, Inc., can be found at https://wavebrowser.com. 

Even though both versions carry the same name, they are not identical twins. In fact, the latter seems to be riding on the coattails of the former, seemingly capitalizing on the .COM domain’s popularity. Sneaky, right?

## Wave Browser At Work: A Unique Experience or a Privacy Nightmare?

Wave Browser aims to be different, offering inbuilt functionalities neatly packed in its sidebar. You’d find shortcuts to Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, Stock Pricing, Instagram, Amazon Price Tracker, and more. Now, that sounds convenient, doesn’t it?

Well, here’s the catch. You can choose to hide these features but cannot disable the extensions. Plus, the default search engine is Yahoo! Sure, you can switch it, but the New Tab page with its search bar and bookmarks remains unaltered. For a product that’s marketed as a ‘Personal’ browser, this feels a bit too pushy. 

On the brighter side, Wave Browser does come with an Ad Block feature. Although it doesn’t work for YouTube, it seems to function well on most other sites. But, yet again, this feature isn’t enabled by default. 

## Is Wave Browser Virus?

Technically speaking, Wave Browser isn’t classified as a virus. However, its potential privacy concerns make it a software you might want to think twice about. 

So, what’s the verdict on the Wave browser? Well, it’s a mixed bag. While it does have some interesting features, the privacy concerns are something you cannot ignore. 

In the world of cyber security, it’s always better to be safe than sorry. If you’re unsure about the security of your Windows 11 computer, consider investing in a [reliable anti-virus software](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). Even better, try a trial version to see if it suits your needs. 

Remember, your digital safety is in your hands. So, make informed decisions and surf smartly.

## Is Wave Browser Safe or Dangerous?

Wave Browser first hit the digital shores under the banner of Eightpoint Technologies. At first glance, it seemed like a decent surfboard to ride the internet waves. It brought to the table some inbuilt features like Price tracking, Messaging, Unit Converter and more. The tricky part? These features can be easily integrated into your favorite web browser using extensions that can be removed anytime. So why settle for a fixed menu when you can have à la carte?

### An Unexpected Undertow

The undercurrent of suspicion around Wave Browser intensified with the version developed by iSign International. Imagine a company that customizes web browsers around sports personalities and celebrities. Sounds fun, right? But here’s the twist.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Wave-Browser-Privacy-policy.webp "Wave-Browser-Privacy-policy")

They advertise themselves as the guardians of anonymity. However, their privacy policy paints a different picture. It reads like a confession of collecting personal information like age, income, religion, and more. So, you’re essentially trading your anonymity for a browser with a celebrity theme. Doesn’t sound like a fair deal, does it?

### Riding the Waves or Sinking?

In essence, both versions of Wave Browser have motives that seem dubious at best. There’s simply no compelling reason to use a modified, reskinned, or forked version of Chromium. 

## A Hidden Reef: Wave Browser as Malware

Now, let’s tackle the elephant in the room. Is Wave Browser malware? Technically, it’s classified as a Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP), which essentially makes it a kind of malware. While it may not pose an immediate risk like a virus, it doesn’t exactly paint a picture of safety.

If you’re seeking a web browser with inbuilt Ad Blocking, Brave could be a good option. There are some [best ad blockers](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) you can try. And for those who prioritize security, there are plenty of [secure web browsers](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) to consider.
