## What Are the Different Types of YouTube Ads?

Before we delve into the methods to stop YouTube ads, it’s essential to understand the various types of ads you might encounter while using the platform:

* **Skippable Video Ads**: These ads allow users to skip the ad after the first few seconds. They typically appear before or during a video.
* **Non-skippable Video Ads**: As the name suggests, you cannot skip these ads and must watch them in their entirety before proceeding to your desired video.
* **Overlay Ads**: These are semi-transparent ads that appear on the lower part of the video player and can be closed easily.
* **Bumper Ads**: Bumper ads are short, non-skippable video ads that usually last for a few seconds.
* **Display Ads**: Display ads appear as banners to the right of the video you’re watching or below the video suggestions.
